How to prevent this is easy you will need to get them a teathing ring and get non wood baby gates. Babies are insane so it educational toys like alphabet cards or tyles or even color sheets to teach them new colors. It is best to potty train them from a young age so they do not grow up and still need diaper changes. I have learned that alot of children like cars, trains, fake guns and planes so try to get them those kinds of toys also they like loud noises. Babies are hemrroids and will get really upset when their mother/father are away, even if it is just for five seconds. Now every parent wishes they had a robot baby sitter so they would not have to pay them and they would do it for free, however babies do not like the idea of the parents leaving and sometimes it is hard to find a babysitter and even more annoying on an anniversery and you want to go out. You should take your child somewhere fun like Chucky cheeses so you can just ignore them the entire time someplace really distracting like Freddy fazbears or Family jump yard. Also if you have ever played Left for dead, babies are like jockeys and will climb all over you, and will bite and scratch and kick and hit you so you will need riot armor and a bb gun.
